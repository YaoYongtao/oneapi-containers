   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Introduction
	============

	  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
	  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
	  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
	  FreeType Project.

	  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
	  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
	  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
	  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

	  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
	  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
	  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
	  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

		o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
		  interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

		o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
		  full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

		o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
		  it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
		  somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
		  FreeType code. (`credits')

	  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
	  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
	  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
	  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

	  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
	  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
	  encourage you to use the following text:

	   """
		Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
		Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
	   """

	  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
	  actually use.


	Legal Terms
	===========

	0. Definitions
	--------------

	  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
	  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
	  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
	  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
	  beta or final release.

	  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
	  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
	  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
	  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
	  engine'.

	  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
	  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
	  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
	  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
	  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
	  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

	  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
	  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
	  specified below.
	1. No Warranty
	--------------

	  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
	  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
	  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
	  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
	  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
	  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

	2. Redistribution
	-----------------

	  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
	  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
	  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
	  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
	  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
	  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
	  herein, subject to the following conditions:

		o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
		  (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
		  the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
		  documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
		  original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
		  files.

		o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
		  states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
		  FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
		  encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
		  documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

	  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
	  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
	  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
	  to us.

	3. Advertising
	--------------

	  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
	  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
	  purposes without specific prior written permission.

	  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
	  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
	  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
	  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

	  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
	  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
	  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
	  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
	  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
	  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
	  of this license.

	4. Contacts
	-----------

	  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

		o freetype@nongnu.org

		  Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
		  future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
		  If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
		  haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

		o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

		  Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
		  specific licenses, porting, etc.

	The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
	It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
	The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
	ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
	but is also freely distributable.

	The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
	To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
	support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
	to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
	algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
	by all standard GIF decoders.
